# My Journey

This repository documents my journey in React.js. Here, I share my struggles, lessons learned, and progress. The purpose is to provide insights into my growth and showcase my development journey to recruiters and others who are interested.

## Struggles
- The project wasn't hard to do, if I need to be honest. I fetched from a URL shortener API, which gives me the short link bank in data.
- Tailwind: I started with mobile-first, then went to desktop, but it was a bit confusing at first on how I could do it. However, after some quick research, I got it working.

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: API 

- Fetching data wasn't as hard as I expected, maybe because it was basic.

### Lesson 2: .maps

- tried to make this project a few weeks back but couldn't do it because I didn't know how I could make a new div pop up when a user inputs data. I'm happy to say that I finally learned it, and it wasn't even that hard. Practice makes perfect, though. 

## Achievements

- Being able to fetch data and create a perfectly working URL shortener site.


## Goals

- My goals right now are to become better with React, React Router, and API fetching. These are the things I really should work on as a frontend developer.
- Next, I would like to train myself with CRUD operations so I can better my skills as a frontend developer.
- I'm on my summer holiday, so I'm going to take this time to fully study, so by next school year, I could have a fantastic portfolio!

## Resources

- Frontend Mentor for the beautiful Figma design files to help me improve my frontend.
